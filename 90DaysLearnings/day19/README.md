### Docker-Volume

Docker allows you to create something called volumes. Volumes are like separate storage areas that can be accessed by containers. 
They allow you to store data, like a database, outside the container, so it doesn't get deleted when the container is deleted. You
can also mount from the same volume and create more containers having same data. reference

### Docker Network

Docker allows you to create virtual spaces called networks, where you can connect multiple containers (small packages that hold all 
the necessary files for a specific application to run) together. This way, the containers can communicate with each other and with 
the host machine (the computer on which the Docker is installed). When we run a container, it has its own storage space that is only
accessible by that specific container. If we want to share that storage space with other containers, we can't do that. reference
