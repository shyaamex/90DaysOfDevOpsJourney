## What is YAML?

YAML means yet another markup language. It is a data serialization language that works well with the modern programming language, and it is human-friendly.
It is used to define the data structures that are very easy to understand. These data structures are very easy to manage and maintain by the users.


YAML uses space to define something. If we use a single space or double space, it has different meanings in YAML. Spaces change the meaning of data structure.
YAML is case sensitive.
YAML is language independent. If we define the YAML once, the same YAML file can be invoked in Python file, Ruby, etc.









## Datatypes in YAML 

YAML has three types of data types:

- Scalar
  - Numeric Data type
  - String
  
- List
- Dictionary




## Goals of YAML



1. Human-readable: YAML is human readable. Humans can easily read it.
2. Portable: YAML can work across multiple programming languages easily.
3. Consistent: YAML is consistent, and it is able to support generic tools.
4. Support various languages: YAML matches the native data structure of agile methodologies like PHP, JavaScript, Perl, Ruby, and Python.
5. One-pass processing: when a programming language goes through the YAML file, it only needs to go through once to complete its task.
6. Extensive and expressive: YAML is extensive, that means it should be easily readable by the human, and it is expressive.
7. Easy Implementation: The implementation of YAML is easy and useful.
