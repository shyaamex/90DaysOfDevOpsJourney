# Learnings of Day 27
<br><br><br>
## Began with Go Lang

### Brief introduction to Go Lang

Go is a programming language which is developed by Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is a statically-typed language. Go has a similar syntax to C. It is developed with the vision of high performance and fast development. Go provides type safety, garbage collection, dynamic-typing capability, many advanced built-in types such as variable length arrays and key-value maps etc.

### The basic structure of a Go programs consists of following parts:-

- Package Declaration
- Import Packages
- Variables
- Statements and Expressions
- Functions
- Comments

### A simple example of Go programming language.

````
package main  
import "fmt"  
func main() {  
   fmt.Println("Hello, World")  
}  
````
### Data types in Go

Data type is an important concept in programming. Data type specifies the size and type of variable values.

Go is statically typed, meaning that once a variable type is defined, it can only store data of that type.

Go has three basic data types:

- **bool:** represents a boolean value and is either true or false
- **Numeric:** represents integer types, floating point values, and complex types
- **string:** represents a string value
