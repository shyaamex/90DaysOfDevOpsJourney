## What is Docker?

Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. 
Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the 
software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. Using Docker, you
can quickly deploy and scale applications into any environment and know your code will run.



## Basic Docker commands
<br>

`docker run` <br>command to start a new container and interact with it through the command line. <br> <br>
`docker inspect` <br>command to view detailed information about a container or image <br><br>
`docker port` <br>command to list the port mappings for a container <br><br>
`docker stats` <br>command to view resource usage statistics for one or more containers <br><br>
`docker top` <br>command to view the processes running inside a container <br><br>
`docker save` <br>command to save an image to a tar archive <br><br>
 `docker load` <br>command to load an image from a tar archive <br><br>
