## Dockerfile

Docker is a tool that makes it easy to run applications in containers. Containers are like small 
packages that hold everything an application needs to run. To create these containers, developers 
use something called a Dockerfile.

A Dockerfile is like a set of instructions for making a container. It tells Docker what base image to use, 
what commands to run, and what files to include. For example, if you were making a container for a website, the 
Dockerfile might tell Docker to use an official web server image, copy the files for your website into the container, 
and start the web server when the container starts.

## Docker-Compose

Docker Compose is a tool that makes it easy to run multiple containers at once. It allows you to define all the containers, 
networks, and volumes for your application in a single file. This file is called a "docker-compose.yml" file.

## Benefits of Docker Compose

● **Single host deployment** - This means you can run everything on a single piece of hardware

● **Quick and easy configuration** - Due to YAML scripts

● **High productivity** - Docker Compose reduces the time it takes to perform tasks

● **Security** - All the containers are isolated from each other, reducing the threat landscape
